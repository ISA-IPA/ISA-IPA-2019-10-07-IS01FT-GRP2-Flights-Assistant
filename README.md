# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
According to IATA, in 2017 airlines carried 4.1 billion passengers by air. Before booking a flight, passengers would have to spend time searching through various platforms to find the best flight deals. That is a lot of time spent searching for flight deals. The search for flight becomes a repetitive task that a passenger would need to perform over a period of time before they find the flight they want.

With the above, we see a potential to develop a service that helps passenger monitors the flight deals on their behalf and send them updates on deals, until the request ended.

Flight Assistant Chatbot (via WeChat app) is developed to help monitor flight deal based on users' request and send daily updates on flight deals they are looking for to their WeChat account. User can click on the hyperlink associated to the deal to access the deal and make the booking.

The decision to use WeChat is driven by the number of WeChat users worldwide and the exposure to both Android and iOS users, as compared to Google assistant.

Users can either send us a voice recording with the type flight request or they text us with the details of their flight request. Users can also specified the number of days that they would like us to monitor the request for.

With the above, our system will perform daily search and send the results to the usersâ€™ WeChat account. Users can also request to extend the monitoring for additional days.
